# Yelp 
The default help viewer for the GNOME desktop.  Yelp provides
a simple graphical interface for viewing Mallard, DocBook, HTML, man,
and info formatted documentation.  The name Yelp was suggested by Daniel
Lundin. Yelp is pronounced the same as the swedish word for 'help'.

The Yelp help viewer builds on yelp-xsl and yelp-tools. You can use
these to build and manage your documentation.

Yelp is developed in GNOME git, and mirrored to GitHub. Please do all
